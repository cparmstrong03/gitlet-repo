# gitlet-repo

This is the third and final project of UC berkeley's cs61b course, which is the second introductory computer science class in the series. This project is
to create a mini version control system, similar to some of the most basic functionalities of git. These functional commands include:
init, add, commit, log, global-log, status, rm, find, checkout, branch, rm-branch, reset, merge. They behave similarly to the corresponding commands 
in git.
